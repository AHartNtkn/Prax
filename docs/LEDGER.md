# Feature Ledger

Every capability we intend `prax` to support, derived from the Versu paper and Praxish. Status:
- **v1** — in the first milestone (faithful engine core).
- **v2** — the core-model round (emotions & relationships), built as `Prax.Core`.
- **v3** — reactions-as-practices & a first norm, built as `Prax.Reactions`.
- **v4** — per-agent beliefs (incl. false beliefs), built as `Prax.Beliefs`.
- **v5** — conversation (speakers, topics, quips), built as `Prax.Conversation`.
- **v6** — a story manager (DM) as a metalevel agent (the bar `director`).
- **v7** — character arcs (internal high-level state), built as `Prax.Arc`.
- **v8** — first-order connectives in the query language (∀/∃/∨/→).
- **v9** — cast removal + a dramatic vertical slice (`Prax.Worlds.Intrigue`).
- **v10** — QA tooling: the inspector (`Prax.Inspect`) and stress-test (`Prax.Stress`).
- **v11** — persistence: save/load a session (`Prax.Persist`), CLI save + resume.
- **v12** — a Prompter-lite scene-authoring layer (`Prax.Script`) that compiles a
  CAST + scene-graph play-script to practices, with an auto flow-chart + scene coverage;
  demonstrated by `Prax.Worlds.Play`. Play-scripts round-trip through readable JSON
  (`Prax.Script.Json`) — the editable authoring format, chosen over a bespoke parser.
- **v13** — player-as-DM: the human occupies the drama-manager slot, steering an
  autonomous cast with metalevel nudges (`Prax.Worlds.Bar` `barDirectorWorld`, `prax dm`).
- **planned** — committed for later; well-understood from sources.
- **research-needed** — blocked on material we haven't obtained (mainly the DEON 2010 exclusion-
  logic paper) or an unsettled design question.

Paper = Evans & Short 2014 (see `docs/research/versu-notes.md`). "P§" = its section/page.

## Core logic engine

| # | Feature | Status | Source | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Trie world-state DB (all state = sentences) | v1 | P§VI | `newtype Db = Db (Map String Db)` |
| 2 | `.` multi-valued descent | v1 | P§VII | |
| 3 | `!` exclusion (single-valued, sibling-clearing) | v1 | P§VII | **fixes Praxish bug** — clears siblings, preserves child subtree |
| 4 | Prefix = object; delete subtree by prefix | v1 | P§VII | `retract` |
| 5 | Unification / pattern match (vars = Capitalized) | v1 | Praxish `db.js` | list-monad over bindings |
| 6 | Query ops: not / eq(assign) / neq / lt·lte·gt·gte / calc / subquery | v1 | Praxish `praxish.js` | typed `Condition` ADT |
| 7 | Full FOL queries: ∀, ∃, ∨, → | v8 | P§VII | `Prax.Query` `Or`/`Absent`/`Exists` + `forAll`/`implies`; nests freely |
| 8 | Static type inference / checker (ML-style) | research-needed | P§VII p.120 | design question: how far to go |

## Practices & actions

| # | Feature | Status | Source | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| 9 | Practices as first-class instantiable objects | v1 | P§VIII | `process.<id>.<roles>` |
| 10 | Role-agnostic practices (any cast fills roles) | v1 | P§VIII | key to replayability |
| 11 | Actions: conditions + outcomes (insert/delete/call) | v1 | Praxish | |
| 12 | Practice `data`, `init`-on-spawn, `functions`/`cases` | v1 | Praxish | |
| 13 | Concurrent practices; options = union of affordances | v1 | P§V | falls out of the loop |
| 14 | Constitutive affordances (only available in-practice) | v1 | P§VIII | |
| 15 | Norms: violation-marking postconditions + norm desires | v3 | P§VIII-D | `Prax.Reactions` `markViolation`/`violationOf`; strong-negative want ⇒ planner avoids |
| 16 | Reactions as practices (spawned by an action's outcomes) | v3 | P§X | `Prax.Reactions` `spawnReaction`/`endReaction`; `disapprovalP`; response chains |
| 17 | Conditional effects / domain axioms in the action language | planned | P§VIII | partly via `call`/`functions` today |

## Agents & action selection

| # | Feature | Status | Source | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| 18 | Utility-based reactive selection (apply-evaluate-undo) | v1 | P§IX | immutability ⇒ no explicit undo |
| 19 | Per-character wants; utility = Σ modifier × #bindings | v1 | P§IX-A | Versu-faithful; supersedes Praxish global goals |
| 20 | Forward-chaining lookahead w/ discounts (0.9 self / 0.5 other) | v1 | Praxish `planner.js` | depth configurable |
| 21 | Wants as arbitrary logic sentences (∃/∀ desires) | v8\* | P§IX-A | unblocked by #7 — a want is now any FOL formula; *runtime want injection still open* |
| 22 | Character arcs / interiority (high-level internal choices) | v7 | P§X | `Prax.Arc`; bex's hopeful→belonging/lonely arc gates its wants; against-desires transformation is player-only |
| 23 | Swaygent-style volition/influence selection | research-needed | Praxish `swaygent.js` | Ensemble-inspired alt selector |

## Core model (emotion / relationship / belief)

| # | Feature | Status | Source | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| 24 | Emotions (Ekman, single-slot, remembers target+cause+prev) | v2 | P§X | `Prax.Core` `setMood`; mood `!`-override + `priorMood` |
| 25 | Role-evaluation relationships (multiple, asymmetric, w/ reason) | v2 | P§X | `Prax.Core` `adjustScore`; `A.relationship.B.role.score!N`/`reason!Why` |
| 26 | Public symmetric relationship state | v2 | P§X | `Prax.Core` `setBond` writes both orderings |
| 27 | Beliefs: shared world + per-issue divergence | v4 | P§X | `Prax.Beliefs` `believe`/`believesThat`/`forget`; `X.believes.<issue>!V` |
| 28 | Quantified / nested beliefs | research-needed | P§XI | Versu itself couldn't do this |
| 29 | Conversation: speakers, topics, quips (template + effects) | v5 | P§X / ES blog | `Prax.Conversation` `quip`/`changeSubject`; speaker turn-taking; quips shift core model & beliefs |

## Story management & authoring

| # | Feature | Status | Source | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| 30 | DM / story manager as a special practice | v6 | P§VI, XI | bar `director`: a bound metalevel agent with story-level wants; injects a rivalry |
| 31 | Player as DM | v13 | P§XI | `Prax.Worlds.Bar` `barDirectorWorld`: the human is bound to the metalevel `direct` practice (stir a rivalry / kindle warmth / cast a pall) and steers an autonomous cast; the CLI offers a bound player only its practice's affordances (via `candidateActions`). `prax dm` |
| 32 | Readable serialization for play-scripts (JSON) | v12 | P§VII-VIII | `Prax.Script.Json`: round-trips a `Script` to/from JSON — an editable authoring/exchange format with no bespoke grammar to maintain; `prax play <file.json>`, `prax dump-play`, `examples/play.json`. (Chosen over a custom `.prompter` parser.) |
| 33 | Prompter-style play-script front end (scene/beat/junction → practices) | v12 | P§XII | `Prax.Script`: CAST + scene-graph eDSL, `compile`, auto `flowChart`; a bodiless narrator fires junctions. Text parser + prose sketches + timed junctions + memories deferred (Stage F) |
| 34 | Deontic `should` / obligation operator; norm-conflict resolution | research-needed | DEON 2010 | **need the paywalled paper** |

## Runtime, tooling, UX

| # | Feature | Status | Source | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| 35 | CLI menu loop (act / more), narration | v1 | P§V UI | |
| 36 | Round-robin turn loop | v1 | Praxish `app.js` | |
| 37 | Deterministic playback / replay | v10 | P§VI | pure loop ⇒ reproducible traces (golden replay); mid-session save/resume-to-file via `Prax.Persist` (v11) |
| 38 | Runtime inspector ("why is X true / why did preconds fail") | v10 | P§VI | `Prax.Inspect` `explain`/`firstFailing` (revives `killsPerStep`) |
| 39 | Stress-test harness (many auto-played runs) | v10 | P§VI | `Prax.Stress` — seeded random all-AI runs; endings + action coverage + dead-ends; **scene coverage** (which scenes random play reaches — Prompter's report) added in v12; CLI `prax stress` |
| 40 | Serializable world state (save/load) | v11 | P§VI | `Prax.Persist` (facts + cursor); exact round-trip; CLI in-game `s` save + `resume` |
| 41 | Rich branching multi-character episode (content) | v9 | P§XII | `Prax.Worlds.Intrigue`: murder, character death (cast-removal), betrayal/loyalty/complicity endings, romance. `Prax.Worlds.Play` (v12) recasts it as a 2-scene play-script |
| 43 | Cast removal (death / eviction) | v9 | P§VIII-D | `dead.<name>` fact; `Prax.Types.livingCharacters`; loop/planner skip the dead |
| 42 | PWIM embedding-based free-text player input | research-needed | arXiv 2406.00942 | external model dependency |
